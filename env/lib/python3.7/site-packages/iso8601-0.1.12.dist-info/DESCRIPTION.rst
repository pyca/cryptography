Simple module to parse ISO 8601 dates

This module parses the most common forms of ISO 8601 date strings (e.g.
2007-01-14T20:34:22+00:00) into datetime objects.

>>> import iso8601
>>> iso8601.parse_date("2007-01-25T12:00:00Z")
datetime.datetime(2007, 1, 25, 12, 0, tzinfo=<iso8601.Utc>)
>>>

Parsed Formats
==============

You can parse full date + times, or just the date. In both cases a datetime instance is returned but with missing times defaulting to 0, and missing days / months defaulting to 1.

Dates
-----

- YYYY-MM-DD
- YYYYMMDD
- YYYY-MM (defaults to 1 for the day)
- YYYY (defaults to 1 for month and day)

Times
-----

- hh:mm:ss.nn
- hhmmss.nn
- hh:mm (defaults to 0 for seconds)
- hhmm (defaults to 0 for seconds)
- hh (defaults to 0 for minutes and seconds)

Time Zones
----------

- Nothing, will use the default timezone given (which in turn defaults to UTC).
- Z (UTC)
- +/-hh:mm
- +/-hhmm
- +/-hh

Where it Differs From ISO 8601
==============================

Known differences from the ISO 8601 spec:

- You can use a " " (space) instead of T for separating date from time.
- Days and months without a leading 0 (2 vs 02) will be parsed.
- If time zone information is omitted the default time zone given is used (which in turn defaults to UTC). Use a default of None to yield naive datetime instances.

Testing
=======

1. pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
2. tox

Note that you need all the pythons installed to perform a tox run (see below). Homebrew helps a lot on the mac, however you wind up having to add cellars to your PATH or symlinking the pythonX.Y executables.

Alternatively, to test only with your current python:

1. pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
2. py.test --verbose iso8601

Supported Python Versions
=========================

Tested against:

- Python 2.6
- Python 2.7
- Python 3.2
- Python 3.3
- Python 3.4
- Python 3.5
- Python 3.6
- PyPy
- PyPy 3

Python 3.0 and 3.1 are untested but should work (tests didn't run under them when last tried).

Jython is untested but should work (tests failed to run).

Python 2.5 is not supported (too old for the tests for the most part). It could work with some small changes but I'm not supporting it.

Changes
=======

0.1.12
------

* Fix class reference for iso8601.Utc in module docstring (thanks to felixschwarz in https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/pull-requests/7/fix-class-reference-for-iso8601utc-in/diff)

0.1.11
------

* Remove logging (thanks to Quentin Pradet in https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/pull-requests/6/remove-debug-logging/diff)
* Add support for , as separator for fractional part (thanks to ecksun in https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/pull-requests/5/add-support-for-as-separator-for/diff)
* Add Python 3.4 and 3.5 to tox test config.
* Add PyPy 3 to tox test config.
* Link to documentation at http://pyiso8601.readthedocs.org/


0.1.10
------

* Fixes https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/14/regression-yyyy-mm-no-longer-parses (thanks to Kevin Gill for reporting)
* Adds YYYY as a valid date (uses 1 for both month and day)
* Woo, semantic versioning, .10 at last.

0.1.9
-----

* Lots of fixes tightening up parsing from jdanjou. In particular more invalid cases are treated as errors. Also includes fixes for tests (which is how these invalid cases got in in the first place).
* Release addresses https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/13/new-release-based-on-critical-bug-fix

0.1.8
-----

* Remove +/- chars from README.rst and ensure tox tests run using LC_ALL=C. The setup.py egg_info command was failing in python 3.* on some setups (basically any where the system encoding wasn't UTF-8). (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/10/setuppy-broken-for-python-33) (thanks to klmitch)

0.1.7
-----

* Fix parsing of microseconds (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/9/regression-parsing-microseconds) (Thanks to dims and bnemec)

0.1.6
-----

* Correct negative timezone offsets (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/8/015-parses-negative-timezones-incorrectly) (thanks to Jonathan Lange)

0.1.5
-----

* Wow, it's alive! First update since 2007
* Moved over to https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601
* Add support for python 3. https://code.google.com/p/pyiso8601/issues/detail?id=23 (thanks to zefciu)
* Switched to py.test and tox for testing
* Make seconds optional in date format ("1997-07-16T19:20+01:00" now valid). https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/pull-request/1/make-the-inclusion-of-seconds-optional-in/diff (thanks to Chris Down)
* Correctly raise ParseError for more invalid inputs (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/1/raise-parseerror-for-invalid-input) (thanks to manish.tomar)
* Support more variations of ISO 8601 dates, times and time zone specs.
* Fix microsecond rounding issues (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/2/roundoff-issues-when-parsing-decimal) (thanks to nielsenb@jetfuse.net)
* Fix pickling and deepcopy of returned datetime objects (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/3/dates-returned-by-parse_date-do-not) (thanks to fogathmann and john@openlearning.com)
* Fix timezone offsets without a separator (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/4/support-offsets-without-a-separator) (thanks to joe.walton.gglcd)
* "Z" produces default timezone if one is specified (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/5/z-produces-default-timezone-if-one-is) (thanks to vfaronov). This one may cause problems if you've been relying on default_timezone to use that timezone instead of UTC. Strictly speaking that was wrong but this is potentially backwards incompatible.
* Handle compact date format (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/6/handle-compact-date-format) (thanks to rvandolson@esri.com)

0.1.4
-----

* The default_timezone argument wasn't being passed through correctly, UTC was being used in every case. Fixes issue 10.

0.1.3
-----

* Fixed the microsecond handling, the generated microsecond values were way too small. Fixes issue 9.

0.1.2
-----

* Adding ParseError to __all__ in iso8601 module, allows people to import it. Addresses issue 7.
* Be a little more flexible when dealing with dates without leading zeroes. This violates the spec a little, but handles more dates as seen in the field. Addresses issue 6.
* Allow date/time separators other than T.

0.1.1
-----

* When parsing dates without a timezone the specified default is used. If no default is specified then UTC is used. Addresses issue 4.
