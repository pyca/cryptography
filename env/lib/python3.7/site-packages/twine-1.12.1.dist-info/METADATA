Twine is `a utility`_ for `publishing`_ Python packages on `PyPI`_.

It provides build system independent uploads of source and binary
`distribution artifacts <distributions>`_ for both new and existing
`projects`_.


Why Should I Use This?
----------------------

The goal of ``twine`` is to improve PyPI interaction by improving
security and testability.

The biggest reason to use ``twine`` is that it securely authenticates
you to `PyPI`_ over HTTPS using a verified connection regardless of
the underlying Python version, while whether or not
``python setup.py upload`` will work correctly and securely depends
on your build system, your Python version and the underlying operating
system.

Secondly, it allows you to precreate your distribution files.
``python setup.py upload`` only allows you to upload something that you're
building with ``distutils`` or ``setuptools``, and created in the same
command invocation. This means that you cannot test the
exact file you're going to upload to PyPI to ensure that it works before
uploading it.

Finally, ``twine`` allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the
``.asc`` files into the command line invocation (``twine upload
myproject-1.0.1.tar.gz myproject-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc``). This enables you
to be assured that you're typing your ``gpg`` passphrase into ``gpg``
itself and not anything else, since *you* will be the one directly
executing ``gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>``.


Features
--------

- Verified HTTPS connections
- Uploading doesn't require executing ``setup.py``
- Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
  distributions before release
- Supports uploading any packaging format (including `wheels`_)


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install twine


Using Twine
-----------

1. Create some distributions in the normal way:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

2. Upload with ``twine`` to `Test PyPI`_ and verify things look right. Twine will automatically prompt for your username and password:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
       username: ...
       password:
       ...

3. Upload to `PyPI`_:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ twine upload dist/*

4. Done!

More documentation on using ``twine`` to upload packages to PyPI is in
the `Python Packaging User Guide`_.

Keyring Support
---------------

Instead of typing in your password every time you upload a distribution, Twine
allows you to store your username and password securely using `keyring`_.

To use the keyring, you must first install the keyring packages:

- On Windows and MacOS you just need to install ``keyring``, for example,
  ``pip install --user keyring``.
- On Linux, in addition to the ``keyring`` package you also need to ensure the
  ``python3-dbus`` system package is installed. For example, ``apt install
  python3-dbus``. See `Keyring's installation instructions`_ for more details.

Once keyring is installed you can use the ``keyring`` program to set your
username and password to use for each package index (repository) you want to
upload to using Twine.

To set your username and password for test PyPI run the following command.
``keyring`` will prompt you for your password:

.. code-block:: console

    $ keyring set https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username
    # or
    $ python3 -m keyring set https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username

To set your username and password for PyPI run this command, again, ``keyring``
will prompt for the password:

.. code-block:: console

    $ keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username
    # or
    $ python3 -m keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username


The next time you run ``twine`` it will prompt you for a username and will grab the appropriate password from the keyring.

.. Note:: If you are using Linux in a headless environment (such as on a
    server) you'll need to do some additional steps to ensure that Keyring can
    store secrets securely. See `Using Keyring on headless systems`_.

Disabling Keyring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, the presence of keyring may be problemmatic. To disable
keyring and defer to a prompt for passwords, uninstall ``keyring``
or if that's not an option, you can also configure keyring to be disabled.

See `twine 338 <https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/338>`_ for a
discussion on ways to do that.

      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            The password to authenticate to the repository

a different package index.

                            be set via TWINE_REPOSITORY environment variable.)
                            Initial package registration no longer necessary on
                            pypi.org:
                            https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-
                            org/
      --repository-url REPOSITORY_URL
                            The repository (package index) URL to register the
                            package to. This overrides --repository. (Can also be
                            set via TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL environment variable.)
      -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                            The username to authenticate to the repository
                            (package index) as. (Can also be set via
                            TWINE_USERNAME environment variable.)
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            The password to authenticate to the repository
                            (package index) with. (Can also be set via
                            TWINE_PASSWORD environment variable.)
      -c COMMENT, --comment COMMENT

                            format.

Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Twine also supports configuration via environment variables. Options passed on
the command line will take precedence over options set via environment
variables. Definition via environment variable is helpful in environments where
it is not convenient to create a `.pypirc` file, such as a CI/build server, for
example.

* ``TWINE_USERNAME`` - the username to use for authentication to the repository.
* ``TWINE_PASSWORD`` - the password to use for authentication to the repository.
* ``TWINE_REPOSITORY`` - the repository configuration, either defined as a
  section in `.pypirc` or provided as a full URL.
* ``TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL`` - the repository URL to use.
* ``TWINE_CERT`` - custom CA certificate to use for repositories with
  self-signed or untrusted certificates.
