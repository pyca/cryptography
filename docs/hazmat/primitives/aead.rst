Authenticated encryption
========================

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead

Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) are encryption schemes
which provide both confidentiality and integrity for their ciphertext. They
also support providing integrity for associated data which is not encrypted.

.. class:: ChaCha20Poly1305(key)

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    The ChaCha20Poly1305 construction is defined in :rfc:`7539` section 2.8.
    It is a stream cipher combined with a MAC that offers strong integrity
    guarantees.

    :param key: A 32-byte key. This **must** be kept secret.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: If the version of
        OpenSSL does not support ChaCha20Poly1305.

    .. method:: decrypt(data, associated_data)

        Decrypts the ``data`` and authenticates the ``associated_data``. If you
        called encrypt with ``associated_data`` you must pass the same
        ``associated_data`` in decrypt or the integrity check will fail.

        :param bytes data: The data to decrypt (with tag **prepended**).
        :param list associated_data: An optional ``list`` of ``bytes-like objects``. This
            is additional data that should be authenticated with the key, but
            is not encrypted. Can be ``None`` if none was used during
            encryption.
        :returns bytes: The original plaintext.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.InvalidTag: If the authentication tag
            doesn't validate this exception will be raised. This will occur
            when the ciphertext has been changed, but will also occur when the
            key or associated data are wrong.

.. class:: AESCCM(key, tag_length=16)

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    .. note:

        AES-CCM is provided largely for compatibility with existing protocols.
        Due to its construction it is not as computationally efficient as
        other AEAD ciphers.

    The AES-CCM construction is composed of the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.AES` block
    cipher utilizing Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) (specified in :rfc:`3610`).

    :param key: A 128, 192, or 256-bit key. This **must** be kept secret.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`
    :param int tag_length: The length of the authentication tag. This
        defaults to 16 bytes and it is **strongly** recommended that you
        do not make it shorter unless absolutely necessary. Valid tag
        lengths are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16.

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: If the version of
        OpenSSL does not support AES-CCM.

    .. doctest::

        >>> import os
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESCCM

        >>> aad = b"authenticated but unencrypted data"
        >>> key = AESCCM.generate_key(bit_length=128)
        >>> aesccm = AESCCM(key)
        >>> nonce = os.urandom(13)
        >>> ct = aesccm.encrypt(nonce, data, aad)
        >>> aesccm.decrypt(nonce, ct, aad)
        b'a secret message'

    .. classmethod:: generate_key(bit_length)

        Securely generates a random AES-CCM key.

        :param bit_length: The bit length of the key to generate. Must be
            128, 192, or 256.

        :returns bytes: The generated key.
