Symmetric encryption
====================

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers

Symmetric encryption is a way to `encrypt`_ or hide the contents of material
where the sender and receiver both use the same secret key. Note that symmetric
encryption is **not** sufficient for most applications because it only
provides secrecy but not authenticity. That means an attacker can't see the
message but an attacker can create bogus messages and force the application to
decrypt them. In many contexts, a lack of authentication on encrypted messages
can result in a loss of secrecy as well.

For this reason in nearly all contexts it is necessary to combine encryption
with a message authentication code, such as
:doc:`HMAC </hazmat/primitives/mac/hmac>`, in an "encrypt-then-MAC"
formulation as `described by Colin Percival`_. ``cryptography`` includes a
recipe named :doc:`/fernet` that does this for you. **To minimize the risk of
security issues you should evaluate Fernet to see if it fits your needs before
implementing anything using this module.** If :doc:`/fernet` is not
appropriate for your use-case then you may still benefit from
:doc:`/hazmat/primitives/aead` which combines encryption and authentication
securely.

.. class:: Cipher(algorithm, mode)

    Cipher objects combine an algorithm such as
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.AES` with a
    mode like
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CBC` or
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CTR`. A simple
    example of encrypting and then decrypting content with AES is:

    .. doctest::

        >>> import os
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
        >>> key = os.urandom(32)
        >>> iv = os.urandom(16)
        >>> cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv))
        >>> encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
        >>> ct = encryptor.update(b"a secret message") + encryptor.finalize()
        >>> decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
        >>> decryptor.update(ct) + decryptor.finalize()
        b'a secret message'

    :param algorithm: A

    :param mode: A :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.Mode`
        instance such as those described
        :ref:`below <symmetric-encryption-modes>`.

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: This is raised if the

        If the requested combination of ``algorithm`` and ``mode`` is
        unsupported an :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm`
        exception will be raised.

    .. method:: decryptor()

        :return: A decrypting
            :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext`

Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms

.. class:: AES(key)

    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a block cipher standardized by NIST.
    AES is both fast, and cryptographically strong. It is a good default
    choice for encryption.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. Either ``128``,
        ``192``, or ``256`` :term:`bits` long.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

.. class:: AES128(key)

    .. versionadded:: 38.0.0

    An AES class that only accepts 128 bit keys. This is identical to the
    standard ``AES`` class except that it will only accept a single key length.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. ``128``
        :term:`bits` long.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

.. class:: AES256(key)

    .. versionadded:: 38.0.0

    An AES class that only accepts 256 bit keys. This is identical to the
    standard ``AES`` class except that it will only accept a single key length.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. ``256``
        :term:`bits` long.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

.. class:: Camellia(key)

    Camellia is a block cipher approved for use by `CRYPTREC`_ and ISO/IEC.
    It is considered to have comparable security and performance to AES but
    is not as widely studied or deployed.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. Either ``128``,
        ``192``, or ``256`` :term:`bits` long.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

.. class:: ChaCha20(key, nonce)

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

    .. note::

        In most cases users should use
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305`
        instead of this class. `ChaCha20` alone does not provide integrity
        so it must be combined with a MAC to be secure.
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305`
        does this for you.

    ChaCha20 is a stream cipher used in several IETF protocols. While it is
    standardized in :rfc:`7539`, **this implementation is not RFC-compliant**.
    This implementation uses a ``64`` :term:`bits` counter and a ``64``
    :term:`bits` nonce as defined in the `original version`_ of the algorithm,
    rather than the ``32/96`` counter/nonce split defined in :rfc:`7539`.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. ``256``
        :term:`bits` (32 bytes) in length.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

    :param nonce: Should be unique, a :term:`nonce`. It is
        critical to never reuse a ``nonce`` with a given key. Any reuse of a
        nonce with the same key compromises the security of every message
        encrypted with that key. The nonce does not need to be kept secret
        and may be included with the ciphertext. This must be ``128``
        :term:`bits` in length. The 128-bit value is a concatenation of the
        8-byte little-endian counter and the 8-byte nonce.
    :type nonce: :term:`bytes-like`

    .. note::

        In the `original version`_ of the algorithm the nonce is defined as a
        64-bit value that is later concatenated with a block counter (encoded
        as a 64-bit little-endian). If you have a separate nonce and block
        counter you will need to concatenate it yourself before passing it.
        For example, if you have an initial block counter of 2 and a 64-bit
        nonce the concatenated nonce would be
        ``struct.pack("<Q", 2) + nonce``.


    .. doctest::

        >>> import struct, os
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
        >>> key = os.urandom(32)
        >>> nonce = os.urandom(8)
        >>> counter = 0
        >>> full_nonce = struct.pack("<Q", counter) + nonce
        >>> algorithm = algorithms.ChaCha20(key, full_nonce)
        >>> cipher = Cipher(algorithm, mode=None)
        >>> encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
        >>> ct = encryptor.update(b"a secret message")
        >>> decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
        >>> decryptor.update(ct)
        b'a secret message'

.. class:: TripleDES(key)

    .. warning::

        This algorithm has been deprecated and moved to the :doc:`/hazmat/decrepit/index`
        module. If you need to continue using it then update your code to
        use the new module path. It will be removed from this namespace in 48.0.0.

    Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard), sometimes referred to as 3DES, is a
    block cipher standardized by NIST. Triple DES has known crypto-analytic
    flaws, however none of them currently enable a practical attack.
    Nonetheless, Triple DES is not recommended for new applications because it
    is incredibly slow; old applications should consider moving away from it.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. Either ``64``,
        ``128``, or ``192`` :term:`bits` long. DES only uses ``56``, ``112``,
        or ``168`` bits of the key as there is a parity byte in each component
        of the key.  Some writing refers to there being up to three separate
        keys that are each ``56`` bits long, they can simply be concatenated
        to produce the full key.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

.. class:: SM4(key)

    .. versionadded:: 35.0.0

    SM4 is a block cipher developed by the Chinese Government and standardized
    in the GB/T 32907-2016. It is used in the Chinese WAPI
    (Wired Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure) standard. (An English
    description is available at `draft-ribose-cfrg-sm4-10`_.) This block
    cipher should be used for compatibility purposes where required and is
    not otherwise recommended for use.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. ``128``
        :term:`bits` in length.
    :type key: :term:`bytes-like`

Weak ciphers

.. warning::

    These ciphers are considered weak for a variety of reasons. New
    applications should avoid their use and existing applications should
    strongly consider migrating away.

    ARC4 (Alleged RC4) is a stream cipher with serious weaknesses in its
    initial stream output. Its use is strongly discouraged. ARC4 does not use
    mode constructions.

    :param key: The secret key. This must be kept secret. Either ``40``,
        ``56``, ``64``, ``80``, ``128``, ``192``, or ``256`` :term:`bits` in
        length.

Modes
~~~~~

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes

.. class:: CBC(initialization_vector)

    CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for block ciphers. It is
    considered cryptographically strong.

    **Padding is required when using this mode.**

    :param initialization_vector: Must be :doc:`random bytes
        </random-numbers>`. They do not need to be kept secret and they can be
        included in a transmitted message. Must be the same number of bytes as
        the ``block_size`` of the cipher. Each time something is encrypted a
        new ``initialization_vector`` should be generated. Do not reuse an
        ``initialization_vector`` with a given ``key``, and particularly do not
        use a constant ``initialization_vector``.
    :type initialization_vector: :term:`bytes-like`

    A good construction looks like:

    .. doctest::

        >>> import os
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes import CBC
        >>> iv = os.urandom(16)
        >>> mode = CBC(iv)

    While the following is bad and will leak information:

        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes import CBC
        >>> iv = b"a" * 16
        >>> mode = CBC(iv)


.. class:: CTR(nonce)

    .. warning::

        Counter mode is not recommended for use with block ciphers that have a
        block size of less than 128-:term:`bits`.

    CTR (Counter) is a mode of operation for block ciphers. It is considered
    cryptographically strong. It transforms a block cipher into a stream

.. class:: GCM(initialization_vector, tag=None, min_tag_length=16)

    .. danger::

        If you are encrypting data that can fit into memory you should strongly
        consider using
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM` instead
        of this.

        When using this mode you **must** not use the decrypted data until
        the appropriate finalization method
        (:meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext.finalize`
        or
        :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.AEADDecryptionContext.finalize_with_tag`)
        has been called. GCM provides **no** guarantees of ciphertext integrity
        until decryption is complete.

    GCM (Galois Counter Mode) is a mode of operation for block ciphers. An
    AEAD (authenticated encryption with additional data) mode is a type of
    block cipher mode that simultaneously encrypts the message as well as
    authenticating it. Additional unencrypted data may also be authenticated.
    Additional means of verifying integrity such as
    :doc:`HMAC </hazmat/primitives/mac/hmac>` are not necessary.

    **This mode does not require padding.**

    :param initialization_vector: Must be unique, a :term:`nonce`.
        They do not need to be kept secret and they can be included in a
        transmitted message. NIST `recommends a 96-bit IV length`_ for
        performance critical situations but it can be up to 2\ :sup:`64` - 1
        :term:`bits`. Do not reuse an ``initialization_vector`` with a given
        ``key``.
    :type initialization_vector: :term:`bytes-like`

    .. note::

        Cryptography will generate a 128-bit tag when finalizing encryption.
        You can shorten a tag by truncating it to the desired length but this
        is **not recommended** as it makes it easier to forge messages, and
        also potentially leaks the key (`NIST SP-800-38D`_ recommends
        96-:term:`bits` or greater).  Applications wishing to allow truncation
        can pass the ``min_tag_length`` parameter.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.5

            The ``min_tag_length`` parameter was added in ``0.5``, previously
            truncation down to ``4`` bytes was always allowed.

    :param bytes tag: The tag bytes to verify during decryption. When
        encrypting this must be ``None``. When decrypting, it may be ``None``
        if the tag is supplied on finalization using
        :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.AEADDecryptionContext.finalize_with_tag`.
        Otherwise, the tag is mandatory.

    :param int min_tag_length: The minimum length ``tag`` must be. By default
        this is ``16``, meaning tag truncation is not allowed. Allowing tag
        truncation is strongly discouraged for most applications.

    :raises ValueError: This is raised if ``len(tag) < min_tag_length`` or the
        ``initialization_vector`` is too short.

    An example of securely encrypting and decrypting data with ``AES`` in the

    .. note::

        AES XTS keys are double length. This means that to do AES-128

Insecure modes
--------------

.. warning::

    These modes are insecure. New applications should never make use of them,
    and existing applications should strongly consider migrating away.


.. class:: ECB()

    ECB (Electronic Code Book) is the simplest mode of operation for block
    ciphers. Each block of data is encrypted in the same way. This means
    identical plaintext blocks will always result in identical ciphertext
    blocks, which can leave `significant patterns in the output`_.

    **Padding is required when using this mode.**

Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers

.. class:: CipherContext

    When calling ``encryptor()`` or ``decryptor()`` on a ``Cipher`` object
    the result will conform to the ``CipherContext`` interface. You can then
    call ``update(data)`` with data until you have fed everything into the
    context. Once that is done call ``finalize()`` to finish the operation and
    obtain the remainder of the data.

    Block ciphers require that the plaintext or ciphertext always be a multiple
    of their block size. Because of that **padding** is sometimes required to
    make a message the correct size. ``CipherContext`` will not automatically
    apply any padding; you'll need to add your own. For block ciphers the
    recommended padding is
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.padding.PKCS7`. If you are using a
    stream cipher mode (such as
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CTR`) you don't have
    to worry about this.

        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CTR`), this will
        return bytes immediately, however in other modes it will return chunks
        whose size is determined by the cipher's block size.

    .. method:: update_into(data, buf)

        .. versionadded:: 1.8

        .. warning::

            This method allows you to avoid a memory copy by passing a writable
            buffer and reading the resulting data. You are responsible for
            correctly sizing the buffer and properly handling the data. This
            method should only be used when extremely high performance is a
            requirement and you will be making many small calls to
            ``update_into``.

        :param data: The data you wish to pass into the context.
        :type data: :term:`bytes-like`
        :param buf: A writable Python buffer that the data will be written
            into. This buffer should be ``len(data) + n - 1`` bytes where ``n``
            is the block size (in bytes) of the cipher and mode combination.
        :return int: Number of bytes written.
        :raises ValueError: This is raised if the supplied buffer is too small.

    .. method:: finalize()

        :return bytes: Returns the remainder of the data.
        :raises ValueError: This is raised when the data provided isn't
            a multiple of the algorithm's block size.

        Once ``finalize`` is called this object can no longer be used and
        :meth:`update` and :meth:`finalize` will raise an
        :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized` exception.

    .. method:: reset_nonce(nonce)

        .. versionadded:: 43.0.0

        This method allows changing the nonce for an already existing context.
        Normally the nonce is set when the context is created and internally
        incremented as data as passed. However, in some scenarios the same key
        is used repeatedly but the nonce changes non-sequentially (e.g. ``QUIC``),
        which requires updating the context with the new nonce.

        This method only works for contexts using
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ChaCha20` or
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CTR` mode.

        :param nonce: The nonce to update the context with.
        :type data: :term:`bytes-like`
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: If the
            algorithm does not support updating the nonce.
        :raises ValueError: If the nonce is not the correct length for the
            algorithm.

.. class:: AEADCipherContext

    When calling ``encryptor`` or ``decryptor`` on a ``Cipher`` object
    with an AEAD mode (e.g.
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM`) the result will
    conform to the ``AEADCipherContext`` and ``CipherContext`` interfaces. If
    it is an encryption or decryption context it will additionally be an
    ``AEADEncryptionContext`` or ``AEADDecryptionContext`` instance,
    respectively. ``AEADCipherContext`` contains an additional method
    :meth:`authenticate_additional_data` for adding additional authenticated
    but unencrypted data (see note below). You should call this before calls to
    ``update``. When you are done call ``finalize`` to finish the operation.

    .. note::

        In AEAD modes all data passed to ``update()`` will be both encrypted
        and authenticated. Do not pass encrypted data to the
        ``authenticate_additional_data()`` method. It is meant solely for
        additional data you may want to authenticate but leave unencrypted.

    .. method:: authenticate_additional_data(data)

        :param data: Any data you wish to authenticate but not encrypt.
        :type data: :term:`bytes-like`
        :raises: :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized`

.. class:: AEADEncryptionContext

    When creating an encryption context using ``encryptor`` on a ``Cipher``
    object with an AEAD mode such as
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` an object
    conforming to both the ``AEADEncryptionContext`` and ``AEADCipherContext``
    interfaces will be returned.  This interface provides one
    additional attribute ``tag``. ``tag`` can only be obtained after
    ``finalize`` has been called.

    .. attribute:: tag

        :return bytes: Returns the tag value as bytes.
        :raises: :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.NotYetFinalized` if called
            before the context is finalized.

.. class:: AEADDecryptionContext

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

    When creating an encryption context using ``decryptor`` on a ``Cipher``
    object with an AEAD mode such as
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` an object
    conforming to both the ``AEADDecryptionContext`` and ``AEADCipherContext``
    interfaces will be returned.  This interface provides one additional method
    :meth:`finalize_with_tag` that allows passing the authentication tag for
    validation after the ciphertext has been decrypted.

    .. method:: finalize_with_tag(tag)

        :param bytes tag: The tag bytes to verify after decryption.
        :return bytes: Returns the remainder of the data.
        :raises ValueError: This is raised when the data provided isn't
            a multiple of the algorithm's block size, if ``min_tag_length`` is
            less than 4, or if ``len(tag) < min_tag_length``.
            ``min_tag_length`` is an argument to the ``GCM`` constructor.

        If the authentication tag was not already supplied to the constructor
        of the :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` mode
        object, this method must be used instead of
        :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext.finalize`.

        :param cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherAlgorithm algorithm:

        Checks that the combination of this mode with the provided algorithm
        meets any necessary invariants. This should raise an exception if they
        are not met.

        For example, the
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CBC` mode uses
        this method to check that the provided initialization vector's length
        matches the block size of the algorithm.
