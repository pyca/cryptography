How does ``cryptography`` compare to NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While ``cryptography`` and `NaCl`_ both share the goal of making cryptography
easier, and safer, to use for developers, ``cryptography`` is designed to be a
general purpose library, interoperable with existing systems, while NaCl
features a collection of hand selected algorithms.

``cryptography``'s recipes layer is similar in design to NaCl.

If you prefer NaCl's design, we highly recommend `PyNaCl`_.
