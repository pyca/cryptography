Test vectors
============

Testing the correctness of the primitives implemented in each ``cryptography``
backend requires trusted test vectors. Where possible these vectors are
obtained from official sources such as `NIST`_ or `IETF`_ RFCs. When this is
not possible ``cryptography`` has chosen to create a set of custom vectors
using an official vector file as input to verify consistency between
implemented backends.

Vectors are kept in the `cryptography_vectors` package rather than within our
main test suite.

Creating test vectors
---------------------

When official vectors are unavailable ``cryptography`` may choose to build
its own using existing vectors as source material.

If official test vectors appear in the future the custom generated vectors
should be discarded.

Any vectors generated by this method must also be prefixed with the following
