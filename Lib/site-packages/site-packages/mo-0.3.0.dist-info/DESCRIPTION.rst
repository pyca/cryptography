Introduction
------------

M-O is a task runner designed to standardise common development tasks across
different projects enabling a low barrier to entry and easy integration with
text editors and IDEs. The inspiration for this project comes from
`Scripts to Rule Them All <https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all>`__.
